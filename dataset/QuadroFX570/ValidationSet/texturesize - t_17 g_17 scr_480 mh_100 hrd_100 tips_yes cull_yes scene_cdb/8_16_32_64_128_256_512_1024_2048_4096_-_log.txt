texturesize - this test is testing multiple texture sizes
these are the fixed parameters for this batch of tests:
  - tile vertices resolution: 17 vertices by 17 vertices
  - grid dimensions: 17 by 17
  - screen size: 480 pixels by 640 pixels
  - hi-resolution tiles depth is 9 tiles including the center tile
  - height reach by the camera: 100 % of the maximum height
  - presence of antialiasing: no
  - presence of fog: no
  - Use Culling: yes
  - Use tipsify: yes
