gridsize - this test is testing multiple grid sizes
these are the fixed parameters for this batch of tests:
  - tile vertices resolution: 25 vertices by 25 vertices
  - texture size for one tile: 128 texels by 128 texels
  - screen size: 480 pixels by 640 pixels
  - height reach by the camera: 100 % of the maximum height
  - presence of antialiasing: no
  - presence of fog: no
  - Use Culling: yes
  - Use tipsify: yes
